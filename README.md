# SkySlope <-> Cordless Media Test Application

This tiny app was created to test the functionality of the Cordless Media API in an otherwise empty application before trying to integrate it into our existing codebases.

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install

# Run in dev mode
pnpm dev

# OR build and run in production mode
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```
